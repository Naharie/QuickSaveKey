Adds a keyboard shortcut to save the player.
If in a single player world it will save both the player and the world.
If in multiplayer, it will only save the player.
Useful in large mod packs or other situations where the game is more prone to crashing. 

In single player there is also a shortcut to quick load the last save for both the player and the world.
This *does not* work in multiplayer due to this being a client only mod and attempting to use the shortcut in multiplayer will print a warning.
